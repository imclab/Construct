# Multiplication

## Givens

 * Vector (v1)
 * Vector (v2)

## Result

 * A vector whose length is the length of v1 times the length of v2

## Algorithm

 1. ACCEPT VECTOR (v1) and VECTOR (v2)
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the ORIGIN of v1 as p1
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the TERMINAL of v1 as p2
 1. DEFINE the VECTOR EQUAL to v2 and PARALLEL to v2 and FROM p1 as v3
 1. DEFINE the VECTOR PARALLEL to v2 and UNIT and FROM p1 as v4
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the TERMINAL of v4 as p3
 1. DEFINE the LINE THROUGH p2 and THROUGH p3 as l1
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the TERMINAL of v3 as p4
 1. DEFINE the LINE THROUGH p4 and PARALLEL to l1 as l2
 1. DEFINE the LINE COINCIDENT to v1 as l3
 1. DEFINE the POINT ON l2 and ON l3 as p5
 1. DEFINE the VECTOR FROM p1 TO p5 as v5
 1. PROVIDE v5
