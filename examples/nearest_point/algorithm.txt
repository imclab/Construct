Given: A point and a group of points
Returns: The point in the group which is nearest to the given point.

Let the point be labeled p1 and the group g1

Algorithm:
0.  ACCEPT POINT (p1) and GROUP<POINT> (g1)
1.  CHOOSE the POINT from g1 as p2
2.  DEFINE the CIRCLE with CENTER p1 THROUGH p2 as c1
3.  SPECIFY PATTERN GROUP<POINT> with GROUPSIZE >= 2 as r1
4.  DEFINE the GROUP FROM g1 with POSITION INSIDE OR ON c1 as g2
5.  IF MATCH r1 to g2 DO nearest_point ELSE PROVIDE p2
