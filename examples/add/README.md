# Addition

## Givens

 * Points (p1,p2)
 * Points (q1,q2)

## Result

 * A pair of points, the distance between them equalling the sum of the original distances

## Algorithm

 1. ACCEPT POINTS (p1,p2) and POINTS (q1,q2)
 1. DEFINE the DISTANCE BETWEEN q1 and q2 as d1
 1. DEFINE the LINE THROUGH p1 and THROUGH p2 as l1
 1. DEFINE the POINT ON l1 and at DISTANCE d1 to p2 
    WHERE DISTANCE BETWEEN p1 and p2 is LESS than DISTANCE BETWEEN p1 and THIS as p3
 1. PROVIDE POINTS (p1,p3)
