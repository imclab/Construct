# Addition

## Givens

 * Vector (v1)
 * Vector (v2)

## Result

 * A vector whose length is the length of v1 plus the length of v2

## Algorithm

 1. ACCEPT VECTOR (v1) and VECTOR (v2)
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the TERMINAL of v1 as p1
 1. DEFINE the VECTOR PARALLEL to v1 and EQUAL to v2 and FROM p1 as v3
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the ORIGIN of v1 as p2
 1. DEFINE the POINT at the TERMINAL of v3 as p3
 1. DEFINE the VECTOR FROM p2 TO p3 as v4
 1. PROVIDE v4
