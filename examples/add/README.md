# Addition

## Givens

 * Points (p1,p2)
 * Points (q1,q2)

## Result

 * A pair of points, the distance between them equalling the sum of the original distances

## Algorithm

 1. ACCEPT POINTS (p1,p2) and POINTS (q1,q2)
 1. DEFINE the LINE THROUGH p1 and THROUGH p2 as l1
 1. DEFINE the POINT at DISTANCE d1 ALONG l1 FROM p2 AWAY FROM p1 as p3<br/>
    WHERE d1 is BETWEEN q1 and q2
 1. PROVIDE POINTS (p1,p3)
