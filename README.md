# Construct

Programming languages have been developed predominantly on the basis of 
algebraic reasoning. As a result, they are composed of strings of symbols
organized sequentially into statements.

This is not the only way to reason. **Construct** presents a method of 
programming using geometry, rather than algebra, as its basis. Information is 
represented as fundamental geometric objects, which are transformed using 
geometric operations that we are all familiar with from the real world.

By presenting programming in a geometric form, **Construct** taps into the 
human brain's vast capabilities in geometric reasoning, which are neglected by 
traditional programming languages. In doing so, **Construct** offers an 
environment which is more accessible to users who think in spatial ways.
