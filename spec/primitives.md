# Primitives

## Object Primitives

Object Primitives represent actual geometric *things*, much like primitive values in a traditional algebraic langauge represent logical or informational units.

 * Point - An atomic position in space
 * Line - An infinite line extending through space
 * Segment - A finite line
 * Circle - A curve which passes through all points at a certain distance from its center

## Measurement Primitives

Measurement Primitives represent geometric information that isn't an actual object, but is useful in describing objects. Measurement primitives are considered *ephemeral* because they cannot be passed in or out of procedures.

 * Angle - The measure of separation between two intersecting lines
 * Distance - The measure of separation between two points

## Collection Primitives

Collection Primitives represent ways to work with multiple objects as a single unit.

 * Group - A finite collection of objects
