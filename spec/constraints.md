# Constraints

Constraints are used to check whether primitives achieve certain criteria.

## Point Constraints

 * Coincident - Given two points, achieved if the points are in exactly the same location

## Line Constraints

 * Coincident - Given two lines, achieved if the lines are in exactly the same location
 * Through - Given a point, achieved if the line passes through that point

## Circle Constraints

 * Coincident - Given two circles, achieved if the circles are in exactly the same location
 * Through - Given a point, achieved if the circle passes through that point

## Vector Constraints

 * Equal - Given two vectors, achieved if the direction and magnitude of the vectors are the same

## Angle Constraints

 * Equal - Given two angles, achieved if the sweep of the angles is the same
